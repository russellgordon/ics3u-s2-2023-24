### Thread 1, Day 4 - Monday, October 23, 2023
#### Agenda
1. Discussion: Don't Repeat Yourself
	- How to keep your code tidy.
	- Capitalization conventions when authoring Swift code.
	- Vocabulary review.
	- Reviewing various solutions to the exercise from yesterday's class.
2. Portfolio: [[Portfolios/Sharing Long Blocks of Code\|Sharing Long Blocks of Code]]
	- Share code, not screenshots of code.
	- Please continue to use screenshots to show the *results* of code being run.
3. Portfolio: [[Portfolios/Handing Comments on Posts\|Handing Comments on Posts]]
	- Do not mark comments as resolved in Notion so that the record of our conversation is preserved and easy to see at a glance.
4. Concept: Computed Properties
	- Structures can do more than just store values - they can calculate values as well.
5. Exercise: Describing 2D and 3D Figures
	- You have been randomly assigned [a 2D or 3D figure to work with](https://www.eqao.com/wp-content/uploads/g9-formula-sheet-academic.pdf).
	- Create a [[Tutorials/Creating an Xcode Playground\|new Xcode playground]] named **Computed Properties Exercise**.
	- Write a structure that models the figure you have been assigned.
		- The structure should use stored properties and computed properties.
	- Make several instances of the structure and test your work.

###### Things to do before our next class
- [ ] Complete the exercise on structures as described above, then write about what you learned in a portfolio entry on [Notion](https://notion.so).
