### Thread 1, Day 12 - Monday, November 6, 2023
#### Agenda
1. Tutorial: [[Tutorials/Running Your Code\|Running Your Code]]
	- When should you run code in the **Previews** window and when should you run it in the full **Simulator** app or on a physical device?
1. Tutorial: [[Tutorials/Adding a Physical Device as a Run Destination\|Adding a Physical Device as a Run Destination]]
	- Learn how to test your apps on an iPhone or iPad.
	> [!NOTE]
	> If you have an Intel Mac, testing your app on a physical device may be much faster than using **Previews** or the **Simulator**.
	> 
	> You can check what type of chip is in your Mac by using the menu sequence **ï£¿ > About This Mac...**
1. Working Period
	- Complete tasks in this order:
		- Stopwatch tutorials
		- Reminders activity described on Day 10

			- Check in with Mr. Gordon in-person to see the interface you should reproduce.
1. Setup: [Font Browser](https://github.com/lcs-rgordon/FontBrowser/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)
	- Optionally, [download and install this app](https://github.com/lcs-rgordon/FontBrowser/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) to have examples of available fonts that are built in to iOS.
	> [!NOTE]
	> This will download a Zip file; you can open the Xcode project using the same steps as described at the start of the [[Tutorials/Running Your Code#Expand the compressed file\|Running Your Code tutorial]].
