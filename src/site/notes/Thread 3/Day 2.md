	> Edits during March Break are totally fine, but not required! Sometimes in a new setting (at home with family, out with friends) we get new ideas for a useful app...
3. Concept: [[Concepts/Introduction to Databases\|Introduction to Databases]]
	- How can information be organized within an app, beyond a simple [[Concepts/Lists\|list]]?

	> [!NOTE]
	> 
	> Please only work on this lesson after you have fully filled in the Brainstorm (green) section of your App Design Journal.

###### Things to do before our next class
