### Thread 1, Day 7 - Friday, October 27, 2023
#### Agenda
1. Productivity: [Negative app](https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/negative/id1378123825?mt=12)
	- Dark mode makes using most parts of our computers comfortable after sundown.
	- PDFs have long been a problem – they still show with a white background.
	- Negative solves this – optionally, try it out.
1. Discussion: [Rubber Duck Debugging](https://rubberduckdebugging.com)
	- Solving logical errors and syntax errors can be frustrating, but everyone deals with it, even experienced programmers.
	- Pairing with a friend to describe what you are trying to do with your code, line by line, can be helpful.
		- Often during this process, you will realize the source of the problem you are having.
	- When a friend is not nearby, [use your duck](https://rubberduckdebugging.com)! 🦆
1. Setup: [SF Symbols App](https://developer.apple.com/sf-symbols/)
	- Not all software developers have graphic design skills.
	- Platform owners like Apple want their users to have a consistent experience when using apps written by different people.
	- One of the ways Apple helps their developers provide that consistent look and feel is by offering a wide variety of built-in images that can be used in apps.
	- Please [download and install](https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/design/resources/download/SF-Symbols-5.dmg) the SF Symbols app now. 
	  > [!TIP]
	  > To use an SF Symbol within a SwiftUI layout, try the following code:
	  > ```swift
	  >   Image(systemName: "bolt")
	  >       .resizable()
	  >       .scaledToFit()
	  >       .frame(width: 20)
	  > ```
1. Setup: [[Tutorials/Creating a New macOS Project with a GUI\|Creating a New macOS Project with a GUI]]
	- Please follow these steps to create a new project for the Bento-Box exercise below.
1. Tutorial: Saving Revisions of Your Work
	- Xcode automatically saves your code as you type.
	- However, it is additionally useful to have "save points" while you author code.
	- Mr. Gordon will explain how to *stage* and *commit* your work to save revisions locally.
	  > [!IMPORTANT]
	  >  As you go forward in this course, *always* commit your work frequently with descriptive messages.
	  >  
	  >  This serves as a form of note-taking, makes it easier to debug problems, and if necessary, makes it possible for you to return to a prior version of your code.
1. Exercise: Create a "Bento-Box" Design
	- Marketing teams must be able to convey new features in a concise manner to an audience.
	- In recent years, Apple has used "Bento-Box" graphics to do so.
	- Try to [[Media/Bento Box Example\|reproduce this image]] using SwiftUI, or use it as inspiration to design a bento-box themed view related to something you care about.
	- Mr. Gordon will demonstrate how to add images into your project.
	- Use [[Media/SwiftUI Views Mastery\|SwiftUI Views Mastery]] as a reference.
	- Here is the [starter code discussed in class](https://gist.github.com/lcs-rgordon/3e9812b1dfd2a776137a807bed860db4) and a [[Media/Bento Box Starter Code\|screenshot of what it looks like]].
	  > [!HINT]
	  > Some keywords to look for examples of:
	  > - foregroundStyle
	  > - cornerRadius
	  > - gradient
	  > - Image
	  >   
	  > **Also:** the keyboard shortcut `Option-Shift-K` produces the Apple logo.

###### Things to do before our next class
- [ ] Complete the exercise on layout as described above, then write about what you learned in a portfolio entry on [Notion](https://notion.so).
- [ ] ==Review your portfolio==
	- We will be doing mid-module portfolio reviews early next week.
	- You will have a short private conversation with Mr. Gordon, and:
		- describe what you have done well by using the evidence in your portfolio
		- identify what you might do to improve
		- categorize your current level of achievement as one of these levels:
			- approaching expectations
			- meeting expectations
			- exceeding expectations

	- Remember: <span style="color:green">**D**on't **R**epeat **Y**ourself</span>
		- Use [strategies we have discussed](https://gist.github.com/russellgordon/a9be1f533e43085c184428bce46d947b) to avoid repeatedly defining similar fields.
1. Setup: Obtain Digital Copies of Your Books
	- Follow the instructions given in class to obtain your digital copies of *SwiftUI Views Mastery* and *Working with Data in SwiftUI*.
1. Setup: Get the iOS Simulator
	- For future classes, this will be needed.
	- We will download it today.
1. Concept: [[Concepts/Introduction to Layout\|Introduction to Layout]]
	- Learn how to create basic page layouts in SwiftUI.
	- Recommend that [you use this playground](https://russellgordon.ca/lcs/2023-24/ics3u/Blueprints.playground.zip) to make your wireframes.

### Thread 1, Day 4 - Monday, October 23, 2023
#### Agenda
1. Discussion: Don't Repeat Yourself
	- How to keep your code tidy.
	- Capitalization conventions when authoring Swift code.
	- Vocabulary review.
	- Reviewing various solutions to the exercise from yesterday's class.
	> [!TIP]
	>  Here is [code that exemplifies the idea of embedding one structure inside another](https://gist.github.com/russellgordon/a9be1f533e43085c184428bce46d947b), and here is a [[Media/Nested Structures Example\|screenshot comparing that code to the cards]] themselves.
2. Portfolio: [[Portfolios/Sharing Long Blocks of Code\|Sharing Long Blocks of Code]]
	- Share code, not screenshots of code.
	- Please continue to use screenshots to show the *results* of code being run.
3. Portfolio: [[Portfolios/Handling Comments on Posts\|Handling Comments on Posts]]
	- Do not mark comments as resolved in Notion so that the record of our conversation is preserved and easy to see at a glance.
4. Concept: Computed Properties
	- Structures can do more than just store values - they can calculate values as well.
	> [!TIP]
	>  Here is [the code we developed and discussed](https://gist.github.com/russellgordon/df50e7fadd13aec68c5e30a840c9796f) in class, and here is a [[Media/Computed Properties Example\|screenshot showing the results]] when the code is run.
1. Exercise: Describing 2D and 3D Figures
	- You have been randomly assigned [a 2D or 3D figure to work with](https://russellgordon.ca/lcs/2023-24/ics3u/g9-formula-sheet-academic.pdf).
	- Create a [[Tutorials/Creating an Xcode Playground\|new Xcode playground]] named **Computed Properties Exercise**.
	- Write a structure that models the figure you have been assigned.
		- The structure should use stored properties and computed properties.
	- Make several instances of the structure and test your work.

###### Things to do before our next class
- [ ] Complete the exercise on structures as described above, then write about what you learned in a portfolio entry on [Notion](https://notion.so).
