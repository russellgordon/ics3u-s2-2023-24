### Thread 1, Day 5 - Wednesday, October 25, 2023
#### Agenda
1. Activity: Modelling a Report Card
	- Create a [[Tutorials/Creating an Xcode Playground\|new Xcode playground]] named **Report Card Exercise**.
	- Work with your partner to author a structure that could efficiently store the data shown [[Media/Report Card Example\|in this report card]].
	- Then create an instance of the report card shown.
	- Remember: <span style="color:green">**D**on't **R**epeat **Y**ourself</span>
		- Use [strategies we have discussed](https://gist.github.com/russellgordon/a9be1f533e43085c184428bce46d947b) to avoid repeatedly defining similar fields.
1. Setup: Obtain Digital Copies of Your Books
	- Follow the instructions given in class to obtain your digital copies of *SwiftUI Views Mastery* and *Working with Data in SwiftUI*.
1. Setup: Get the iOS Simulator
	- For future classes, this will be needed.
	- We will download it today.
1. Concept: [[Concepts/Introduction to Layout\|Introduction to Layout]]
	- Learn how to create basic page layouts in SwiftUI.
	- Recommend that [you use this playground](https://russellgordon.ca/lcs/2023-24/ics3u/Blueprints.playground.zip) to make your wireframes.
	- Please continue to use screenshots to show the *results* of code being run.
1. Exercise: Create a Wireframe Layout
	- Select at least two layouts [from these examples](https://russellgordon.ca/lcs/2023-24/ics3u/wireframes.pdf).
	- Use the same concepts we have just looked at to wireframe the layouts you selected.

###### Things to do before our next class
- [ ] Complete the exercise on layout as described above, then write about what you learned in a portfolio entry on [Notion](https://notion.so).

### Thread 1, Day 4 - Monday, October 23, 2023
#### Agenda
1. Discussion: Don't Repeat Yourself
	- How to keep your code tidy.
	- Capitalization conventions when authoring Swift code.
	- Vocabulary review.
	- Reviewing various solutions to the exercise from yesterday's class.
	> [!TIP]
	>  Here is [code that exemplifies the idea of embedding one structure inside another](https://gist.github.com/russellgordon/a9be1f533e43085c184428bce46d947b), and here is a [[Media/Nested Structures Example\|screenshot comparing that code to the cards]] themselves.
2. Portfolio: [[Portfolios/Sharing Long Blocks of Code\|Sharing Long Blocks of Code]]
	- Share code, not screenshots of code.
	- Please continue to use screenshots to show the *results* of code being run.
3. Portfolio: [[Portfolios/Handling Comments on Posts\|Handling Comments on Posts]]
	- Do not mark comments as resolved in Notion so that the record of our conversation is preserved and easy to see at a glance.
4. Concept: Computed Properties
	- Structures can do more than just store values - they can calculate values as well.
	> [!TIP]
	>  Here is [the code we developed and discussed](https://gist.github.com/russellgordon/df50e7fadd13aec68c5e30a840c9796f) in class, and here is a [[Media/Computed Properties Example\|screenshot showing the results]] when the code is run.
1. Exercise: Describing 2D and 3D Figures
	- You have been randomly assigned [a 2D or 3D figure to work with](https://russellgordon.ca/lcs/2023-24/ics3u/g9-formula-sheet-academic.pdf).
	- Create a [[Tutorials/Creating an Xcode Playground\|new Xcode playground]] named **Computed Properties Exercise**.
	- Write a structure that models the figure you have been assigned.
		- The structure should use stored properties and computed properties.
	- Make several instances of the structure and test your work.

###### Things to do before our next class
- [ ] Complete the exercise on structures as described above, then write about what you learned in a portfolio entry on [Notion](https://notion.so).

	- Here is a [close-up of a retro-style hockey card for an imaginary player](https://russellgordon.ca/lcs/2023-24/ics3u/retro-75-hockey-card-template.jpg).
	- Here is an image of [several similar cards](https://russellgordon.ca/lcs/2023-24/ics3u/album-of-retro-75-custom-hockey-cards.jpg).
	- Write structure(s) in your playground to describe the data shown in the hockey cards.
	- Then create *instances* of your structure for at least three hockey cards.

	  > [!NOTE]
	  > Check your email for an invitation to join the Apple Developer program via Lakefield College School.
	  > 
	  > **Please create a new Apple ID using your LCS email address to accept the invitation.**
	  > 
	  > When creating your Apple ID, use the school's street address, but your own phone number. The complete address for LCS is:
	  > 
	  >  `4391 County Road 29`
	  >  `Lakefield College School`
	  >  `Lakefield ON K0L2H0`
	  >  `Canada`
5. Install Xcode 15
	- Use [[Setup/Xcodes\|Xcodes]] to install Xcode 15.
	  > [!TIP]
	  > Do not install Xcode via the App Store, as using this method means that it will automatically get upgraded when a new version is released (which is not always ideal).
6. [[Activities/Programming with Purpose\|Programming with Purpose]]
	- Please watch the video and respond to the prompts provided.
###### Things to do before our next class
- [ ] Be sure that you have installed Xcodes and Xcode, as described above.
