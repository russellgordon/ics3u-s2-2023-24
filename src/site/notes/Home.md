### Thread 1, Day 10 - Friday, November 3, 2023
#### Agenda
1. Setup: Connecting Xcode to GitHub
	- Please follow this link to [create a new access token](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new?scopes=repo,user,admin:public_key,write:discussion) so that Xcode can push your commits to a remote on GitHub.
	- Mr. Gordon will provide remaining instructions.
2. Activity: Modelling a Book Listing
	- Create a [[Tutorials/Creating an Xcode Playground\|new Xcode playground]] named **Book Listing Exercise**.
	- Work with a partner to author a structure that could efficiently store the data shown [[Media/Book Listing Example\|in this online book listing]].
	> [!NOTE]
	> You can write down your rough ideas on the hard copies of [[Media/Book Listing Example\|this example]] that are being handed out.
	- Remember: <span style="color:green">**D**on't **R**epeat **Y**ourself</span>
		- Use [strategies we have discussed](https://gist.github.com/russellgordon/a9be1f533e43085c184428bce46d947b) to avoid repeatedly defining similar fields.
2. Activity: [[Tutorials/Reproducing the Stopwatch\|Reproducing the Stopwatch]]
	- Learn how to reproduce the interface of a real iOS app.
	> [!NOTE]
	> Aim to finish this activity today if you have not done so yet.
3. Activity: Reminders App
	- Create a [[Tutorials/Creating a New iOS Project\|new project for iOS]] named **Reminders App**.
	- Work alone or with a partner to [[Media/Reminders Example\|analyze this interface]] and then apply what you learned from reproducing the Stopwatch app to reproduce this interface.
	- Focus on the main portion of the interface at first – that is, the list.
	- Then, use SwiftUI Views Mastery, and look up the `NavigationStack` structure (pages 313 to 321) for examples of how to add:
		- a navigation title
		- toolbar items (also see pages 681 to 684)
		  > [!TIP]
		  > Do not worry about items like the battery icon, WiFi status, or cellular network – these are provided in a real app by the operating system and you do not have to worry about adding these to an interface as an app developer.

###### Things to do before our next class
- [ ] Take half an hour to make further progress on the activities from today's class, if you did not finish up while in class.
