### Thread 3, Day 2 - Tuesday, March 5, 2024
#### Agenda

1. Video: [New Beginnings](https://player.vimeo.com/video/173099570?h=40bc579bcd&color=ffffff)
	- What problems are being solved by developers in this video?
1. Activity: App Design Journal
	- Continue working through the Brainstorm (green) section of this document.
	- Aim to complete the green section before you leave for March Break.
	> [!TIP]
	> 
	> Edits during March Break are totally fine, but not required! Sometimes in a new setting (at home with family, out with friends) we get new ideas for a useful app...
3. Concept: [[Concepts/Introduction to Databases\|Introduction to Databases]]
	- How can information be organized within an app, beyond a simple [[Concepts/Lists\|list]]?
	- Almost every application you use has a database behind it.
	- Read on to learn what a database is and how to query it (obtain information) from it.
	> [!NOTE]
	> 
	> Please only work on this lesson after you have fully filled in the Brainstorm (green) section of your App Design Journal.

###### Things to do before our next class
- [ ] Complete item 2 as described above, asking questions of Mr. Gordon as needed.
	- There is no need to work on item 3 outside of class time.
