### Thread 2, Day 4 - Monday, January 15, 2024
#### Agenda

1. Concept: [[Concepts/Introduction to Interactive Apps\|Introduction to Interactive Apps]]
2. Concept: [[Concepts/Separation of Concerns\|Separation of Concerns]]
	- Learn how to leverage existing code you have already written to write an interactive app.
	- Learn how to keep user interface code (the view) separate from data and logic (the model).
3. Recap: [Develop in Swift Tutorials](https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/develop-in-swift-tutorials)
	- Chapters 1, 2, and 3 cover concepts that are largely review but still good practice.
	- Chapters 4 and 5 get into topics that we will learn about in this module, and can be completed as a preview of topics that Mr. Gordon will author separate lessons for.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> There is far too much content listed today to complete in a single class.
> 
> While Mr. Gordon is away with illness, use each class to make progress based on where *you* are, personally, with your learning. Some students have already completed items 1 and 2 above, so they should work on item 3. Some students have not completed any of these items, so they should begin with item 1.

###### For Evening Study
- [ ] Take a maximum of 30 minutes and make progress on one of the items listed above.
- [ ] Be sure to continue posting on Notion to share progress and ask questions.
	- Mr. Gordon is not well enough to be at school but will make an effort to send some replies and feedback through Notion.
