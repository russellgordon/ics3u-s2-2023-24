# Xcodes

Xcodes is an app to manage the installation of different versions of Xcode:

You can directly [download Xcodes](https://github.com/XcodesOrg/XcodesApp/releases/download/v1.10.0b18/Xcodes.zip) here; an [overview of the app can be found here](https://www.xcodes.app).

Once downloaded, you will have a compressed file:

Double-click the file to de-compress it, then drag the resulting Xcodes app to your Applications folder:

Open Xcodes.

Next, log in using your LCS Apple ID information (this is what gives you access to Apple Developer resources).

To do this, choose **Xcodes > Settings...**, then select the **Sign-in** button under **Apple ID**:

Finally, to see what versions of Xcode are available to install, you might need to refresh the list – click the button highlighted in red here:

You can then use Xcodes to remove older versions of Xcode from your computer before or after installing a new version (depending on how much available disk space you have).
