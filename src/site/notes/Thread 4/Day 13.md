1. Culminating Task: Working Period
	- A gentle reminder that code for the culminating task must be committed and pushed by 10 PM tomorrow (Friday).
	- Continue the process of handing in your work
		- Make a post [on Notion](https://notion.so) using the **Culminating Task** template, like this:

			- Fill in the blanks that are provided.
			- Please, do not alter the template.
			- See [this exemplar](https://lakefieldcs.notion.site/Culminating-Task-a74824bb7ac44200b3fd620e408bfe3e).
			> [!IMPORTANT]
			> Completing this entry in your portfolio is how your work will be handed in. This must be completed, in full, no later than 11 AM on the date of your end-of-year interview.
	- Continue building your culminating task app.
		- Resources that may be useful:
			- [[Media/SwiftUI Views Mastery\|SwiftUI Views Mastery]]
			- For those students using databases
				- [[Concepts/Querying Multiple Tables\|Querying Multiple Tables]]
					- How to handle one-to-many and many-to-one relationships
				- [[Concepts/Querying Multiple Tables, Part 2\|Querying Multiple Tables, Part 2]]
					- How to handle many-to-many relationships
				- [[Examples/Working with Dates and a Database\|Working with Dates and a Database]]
					- How data types match up for using dates ==(new)==
			- Exemplar being built by Mr. Gordon
				- The [Keynote prototype](https://www.russellgordon.ca/lcs/2023-24/ics3u/App_Prototype_Exemplar.zip) that identifies what he is aiming for
				- Videos showing how he is building this app:
					- [Static interface construction, part 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82ltYV72fKM)
					- [Static interface construction, part 2 ](https://youtu.be/23HaaW3zld8)
					- [Making the app interactive using arrays ](https://youtu.be/u1DgK1F3sjM)
					  > [!TIP]
					  > Have a look the chapters in each video – it's probably unlikely that you would want to watch every minute of every video, but it's likely that everyone will find at least one chapter of one of these videos useful.
