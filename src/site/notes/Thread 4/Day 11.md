			- The [Keynote prototype](https://www.russellgordon.ca/lcs/2023-24/ics3u/App_Prototype_Exemplar.zip) that identifies what he is aiming for
			- Videos showing how he is building this app:
				- [Static interface construction, part 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82ltYV72fKM)
				- [Static interface construction, part 2 ](https://youtu.be/23HaaW3zld8)
				- [Making the app interactive using arrays ](https://youtu.be/u1DgK1F3sjM)
				> [!TIP]
				> Have a look the chapters in each video – it's probably unlikely that you would want to watch every minute of every video, but it's likely that everyone will find at least one chapter of one of these videos useful.
