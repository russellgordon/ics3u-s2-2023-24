### Thread 4, Day 7 - Friday, May 31, 2024
#### Agenda

1. Culminating Task: Create Static Interfaces
	- You have one more day to work on your static interfaces this week.
		- Use your Keynote prototypes as a reference.
		- Be sure to use [[Media/SwiftUI Views Mastery\|SwiftUI Views Mastery]] as a reference while building out static interfaces.
		> [!TIP]
		> If you prefer, rather than making a truly static interface (where data is embedded in views as string literals) you can can instead [[Concepts/Abstraction Using Lists\|store data in arrays and apply abstraction]] (which makes building an app out easier).
		- Remember to use source control â€“ commit and push your work frequently.
		> [!REMINDEr]
		> 
		> Next week, with guidance from Mr. Gordon, you will design, create, and populate your app's database.
		> 
		> Note that this step is necessary for completion of culminating tasks but database design and creation is *not* being evaluated.
		> 
		> If you are ready now, see Mr. Gordon today in class, and he will give you the condensed version of the database design and creation lesson on the spot.
