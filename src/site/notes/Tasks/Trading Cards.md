# Trading Cards
## Objective

Create the look and feel of trading cards for sports, board games, video games, or other areas of interest.

## Purpose

A second opportunity to demonstrate your understanding of key concepts from the first thread of this course. Specifically, using structures to:

- describe related data
- build user interfaces

## Success criteria and exemplar
1. Made a rough plan where you have identified how various structures (`VStack`, `HStack`, `ZStack`, `Image`, et cetera) might be used to create part of your design.
   
   For example:
   
   ![Pasted image 20230112102153.png](/img/user/Media/Pasted%20image%2020230112102153.png)
   
   And:
   
   ![Pasted image 20230112102253.png](/img/user/Media/Pasted%20image%2020230112102253.png)
   
2. Created a static layout where the look and feel of a trading card is reproduced.
   
   ![Screenshot 2023-01-12 at 10.24.42 AM.png](/img/user/Media/Screenshot%202023-01-12%20at%2010.24.42%20AM.png)
   
3. Created a structure named `TradingCard` (or similar) using appropriate property names, capitalization, and selection of data types that will allow you to store the data shown on your card's static layout.
   
   ![Screenshot 2024-01-18 at 7.57.49 AM 1.png|275](/img/user/Media/Screenshot%202024-01-18%20at%207.57.49%E2%80%AFAM%201.png)
   
4. Created instances of your structure to hold information for cards.
   
   Here is one example:
   
   ![Screenshot 2024-01-18 at 8.00.02 AM.png|600](/img/user/Media/Screenshot%202024-01-18%20at%208.00.02%E2%80%AFAM.png)
      
5. Applied abstraction by converting your static layout to use a property named `card` (or similar) that accepts an instance of your `TradingCard` structure.
   
   To demonstrate even more mastery of abstraction, use *helper views* to make the layout more concise and easier to understand:
   
   ![Screenshot 2024-01-18 at 8.13.09 AM.png](/img/user/Media/Screenshot%202024-01-18%20at%208.13.09%E2%80%AFAM.png)
   
   ==NOTE==: You used helper views to [[Tutorials/Reproducing the Stopwatch#Creating the buttons\|draw the buttons on the Stopwatch app]] interface in thread 1.
   
6. Made use of a SwiftUI `List` structure to allow for navigation down to several different cards:
   
   ![Screenshot 2024-01-18 at 8.15.11 AM 1.png](/img/user/Media/Screenshot%202024-01-18%20at%208.15.11%E2%80%AFAM%201.png)
   
7. Written code that is well-formatted and easy to read.
   
8. You have used source control well by [committing and pushing your work](https://www.russellgordon.ca/cs/source-control/introduction/using-source-control.pdf) to a remote on GitHub at regular intervals.
   
   ![Screenshot 2023-01-12 at 10.39.33 AM.png|500](/img/user/Media/Screenshot%202023-01-12%20at%2010.39.33%20AM.png)
   
   ==NOTE:== This is not a complete list of commits; your actual list of commits would be much longer.

## What you'll need to begin
- [ ] Xcode
- [ ] the [SF Symbols App](https://developer.apple.com/sf-symbols/) installed on your computer, also for reference
- [ ] your copy of SwiftUI Views Mastery, downloaded to your computer, so you can look up examples as needed
      
## Getting started

1. Create a new iOS app:
   
   ![Screenshot 2023-01-12 at 9.18.08 AM.png|700](/img/user/Media/Screenshot%202023-01-12%20at%209.18.08%20AM.png)
   
2. Name the app `TradingCards`:
   
   ![Screenshot 2023-01-12 at 9.18.22 AM.png|700](/img/user/Media/Screenshot%202023-01-12%20at%209.18.22%20AM.png)
   
3. Save the app in your Computer Studies folder, ensuring that source control is enabled:
   
   ![Screenshot 2023-01-12 at 9.18.37 AM.png|700](/img/user/Media/Screenshot%202023-01-12%20at%209.18.37%20AM.png)
   
4. Then create a public remote on GitHub:
   
   ![Screenshot 2023-01-12 at 10.06.32 AM.png|400](/img/user/Media/Screenshot%202023-01-12%20at%2010.06.32%20AM.png)
   
5. Now work to complete each item described above in the [[Tasks/Trading Cards#Success criteria and exemplar\|success criteria]].
   
   ==Please remember to commit and push your work regularly.==

## Progress and due date

The task is due by 11 PM this Wednesday, January 24, 2023.

Prior to the final deadline, [on Notion](https://notion.so):
- [ ] Share progress regularly
	- [ ] Be sure to post screenshots
	- [ ] ==Be sure to post the address of your GitHub remote at some point==

> [!NOTE]
> Your work is not considered as handed in until the GitHub remote has been shared *and* you have [[Tutorials/Pushing Commits to GitHub\|committed and pushed]] all your work.

> [!TIP]
> 
> Yes, you have a second working period on Monday, but...
> 
> ![star-wars-its-a-trap-3944237924.gif](/img/user/Media/star-wars-its-a-trap-3944237924.gif)
> 
> ... don't fall for it. Get a solid plan in place during the first working period. Get [[Tutorials/Creating a New iOS Project\|your project created]] and get started. Make *significant* progress over the weekend. Then... put the finishing touches on your assignment on Monday.

## Further examples

Here are some examples of possible layouts that you could aim to reproduce, or use as inspiration for a similar layout:

![Trading Card Template Examples-6 (dragged).png|400](/img/user/Media/Trading%20Card%20Template%20Examples-6%20(dragged).png)

![Trading Card Template Examples-8 (dragged).png|400](/img/user/Media/Trading%20Card%20Template%20Examples-8%20(dragged).png)

![Trading Card Template Examples-9 (dragged).png|400](/img/user/Media/Trading%20Card%20Template%20Examples-9%20(dragged).png)

## Typefaces

You can use other typefaces in iOS applications.

Consult [iOS Font List](https://iosfontlist.com/#availability=10.0&preinstalled) for a quick reference.

## Final advice

> [!IMPORTANT]
> 
> Do *not* use frames for positioning. Your layout should work well on multiple screen sizes.
> 
> Put another way, use frames only to size the width or height of an image, but not both.
